# Optimal histograms with Outliers: a Python Implementation and Experimentation.
A python implementation of the algorithms described in the following paper:

Rachel Behar, Sara Cohen. Optimal Histograms with Outliers. EDBT 2020: 181-192. https://openproceedings.org/2020/conf/edbt/paper_93.pdf

This project was implemented under the frame of the Database Systems course of the DSIT MSc programme @ NKUA



## Download and set up the project

1. Clone the repository.
  `$:git clone https://github.com/AlexandrosKal/opt_hist.git`

2. Go to opt_hist directory. 
  `$:cd opt_hist`
3. Set up a virtual enviroment and install the requirements.
  - `$:python3 -m venv ./venv`
  - `$:source ./venv/bin/activate`
  - `$:pip3 install wheel && pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 
4. Run jupyter lab:
  `$:jupyter lab`
5. In jupyter lab find the notebooks in the experiments folder and run the exeriments (there are instructions there).
